   <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It uses tags and elements to define how text, images, and other content are displayed in a web browser. HTML provides the basic structure for web pages, similar to a skeleton for a body, and is used with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build complete web applications.  </p>
